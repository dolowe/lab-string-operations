# Lab | String Operations


## Introduction

In this lab, we will learn how to manipulate strings. We will combine strings, split them apart, and use regular expressions to filter strings.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Follow the instructions and add your code and explanations as necessary. By the end of this lab, you will have learned about string manipulation and regular expressions.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
